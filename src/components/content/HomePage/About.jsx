        <h1>About</h1>
        <h4 className="subheader">Hi, I'm Dante!</h4>
        <p> I am an experienced engineering professional, currently working at Charter Communications (Spectrum) 
            in a technical rotational program, where I have the chance to learn from several software engineering teams 
            across the company. Over the past few years, I have been working to transition in my career to software 
            engineering roles, and a significant step in that process was earning my Master's degree in Computer Science. 
            In my prior internship experience, I've learned a lot about programming, computer networking, 
            configuration management, container orchestration, and Linux system administration. 
            In the past, I worked in healthcare information technology as a technical solutions engineer at Epic, where I 
            learned a lot about maintaining client relationships, handling escalations, using code to search databases 
            and debug technical issues, and mentoring/advising newer staff. 
        </p>
        <p> In my coursework I've also gotten to work developing websites and applications, and have built up experience 
            with several coding languages, including Python, Java, C, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
        </p>
        <p> In my work, I've also developed an enthusiasm for teaching others skills I've picked up and what they should 
            watch out for. I've often found this is not only an effective way for learning but can also solidify my own 
            understanding of a concept. At Epic, I served in many teaching roles, including as a mentor to new staff, 
            an advisor to employees beginning to work with customers, and teaching classes about how functionalities in Epic 
            worked.
        </p>

        <p> I'm excited to work in roles where I have a chance to develop and improve large scale systems/high impact 
            products that consumers use on a daily basis, use my programming skills, and serve in some kind of mentor capacity.
        </p>

        <p> Please connect with me if you'd like to know more about my professional experience!
